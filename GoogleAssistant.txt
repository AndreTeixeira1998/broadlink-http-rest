Google Assistant Integration

Since this project is capable of talking to various devices and automating
various aspects, it's natural to want to link it up with your Google account
and control it with your voice.

Here is a somewhat simplified solution, but it works.  You'll need an IFTTT
account (IF This Then That, https://ifttt.com) and either the app and/or Google
Home device.  Your device running the server MUST be accessible from the 
Internet, so you'll have to forward a port.  Sorry.

If you don't have a static IP, visit duckdns.org to set up a free dynamic dns

Security is an issue. If you have older code that depends on older GET requests
you can add a line to settings.ini in the [General] section called
"restrictAccess".  Old GET requests are restricted to only these IPs

Ex: "restrictAccess = 192.168.12.156 192.168.12.200 192.168.12.155"

Now, a password for everyone else to use in a POST

Ex: "password = ILoveToHackGoogle"

IFTTT is based on a Trigger, and a Service.  Select Google Assistant as the
trigger and type or say the words you want as a trigger.  A response is totally
optional.

Ex: "I want to listen to some tunes"

Now, when prompted select the Webhooks service.  Fill it out like so:
  URL           http://myhostname:8080/LivingRoom/sendCommand/playSomeJazz
  METHOD        Post
  Content-Type  application/json
  Body          { "password": "ILoveToHackGoogle" }


Substitute your own hostname, deviceName, and command.  I generally use macros
for my commands.  This is a command that looks just like a regular command
definition, except that the data is the word MACRO followed by a list of the
commands that make up the macro.  You can add delays with "sleep1", "sleep2",
"sleep3", etc.

Here are a list of some of my macros.

#- this is used like a constant in other macros to wait for the menu to appear
waitForMenu = MACRO sleep11
#- this opens the TV's main cast menu, it will turn on the TV if needed
openMainMenu = MACRO castnow
#- these are self explanatory
increaseVolume = MACRO volup,4
decreaseVolume = MACRO voldown,5
#- Turns on the TV to iHeartRadio, waits, then selects a channel with arrows
playSomeJazz = MACRO iheartradio waitForMenu up right ok sleep3 right,4 sleep1 ok
#- Turn on the TV, turn down the AC while we wait, then arrow over to Haystack
wakeUpTime = MACRO openMainMenu acdown,4 waitForMenu openNewsFromMain
#- Turn off the TV, turn up the AC, and switch the amp to standby
sleepyTime = MACRO power acup,4 amppower
#- Complex macro for arrowing over to Haystack news
watchTheNews = MACRO openMainMenu waitForMenu openNewsFromMain
openNewsFromMain = MACRO down,3 sleep1 right,15 sleep1 ok


You can use IFTTT to do other home automations too.
