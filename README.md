Broadlink HTTP server/proxy with REST API
==================================
Supported devices: RM/RM2/RM Pro/RM3/BlackBean/A1
-------------------------------------------------

Uses [python-broadlink](https://github.com/mjg59/python-broadlink)

Based and inspired by [BlackBeanControl](https://github.com/davorf/BlackBeanControl)

Example usage
-------------

1) Update settings.ini with your configuration

You can erase the section for specific devices to have the system auto-detect.
These settings will be rewritten to the settings.ini file so that it doesn't
need auto-detection for the next run.

If you have more than one IP address, you can restrict serverAddress to an IP

2) Start python server.py

If no devices are in settings.ini, note the names of the devices found.  These
will be named by the hostname, so make sure the IP address resolves or enter
it in /etc/hosts

3) In your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/learnCommand/lampon   #learn command with name lampon
http://localhost:8080/sendCommand/lampon    #send command with name lampon
```
If you have more than one device, use the alternate syntax
```
http://localhost:8080/deviceName/learnCommand/lampon   #learn command with name lampon
http://localhost:8080/deviceName/sendCommand/lampon    #send command with name lampon
```

4) Added get temperature from supported devices (like RM2/Pro):
```
http://localhost:8080/getStatus/temperature
```
Returns:
```
{ "temperature": 22.2 } 
```
*required JSON format suites [homebridge-http-temperature](https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-temperature) plugin.

5) Added support for A1 sensors (temperature, lights and etc..)
```
http://localhost:8080/a1/temperature
http://localhost:8080/a1/lights
http://localhost:8080/a1/noise
and etc..
```
Returns:
```
{ "temperature": 22.2 } 
{ "lights": dark } 
{ "noise": low } 
and etc..
```
*required JSON format suites [homebridge-http-temperature](https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-temperature) plugin.

6) Get and Set status of devices having COMMANDon and COMMANDoff abilities
```
http://localhost:8080/sendCommand/lampon #automaticly set status of "lamp" to "on"
http://localhost:8080/getStatus/lamp     #return lamp status as 0 or 1
```
